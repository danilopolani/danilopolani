### Hi there ğŸ‘‹ I'm **Theraloss**!

<!--
**danilopolani/danilopolani** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Twitch PubSub](https://github.com/danilopolani/twitch-pub-sub/) and [Betterstream.tv](https://betterstream.tv/), all products around Twitch and Laravel.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on everything related to **Laravel** (the core itself too) and its projects, like [Backpack](https://backpackforlaravel.com/).
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: You can DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/theraloss)!
- âš¡ Fun fact: **Theraloss** is an elfic name. I got it from a random elfic name generator for my first D&D campaign <img src="https://static-cdn.jtvnw.net/emoticons/v1/303744090/3.0">
